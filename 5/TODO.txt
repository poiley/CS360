DONE
client local commands lcd, lpwd, lmkdir, lrmdir, lrm, lcat, lls
server commands pwd, ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, rmdir, rm, put
set server to virtual root 

TODO
server(non local) command get
implement server and client of seperate hosts (not just local host)

IMPROVE
lls includes . and .. directories in it's print out - may want to skip those?
virtual root - if chroot fails on premission, allows to continue at true root, may want to change that to exit and make you run as sudo.
may want to test put a little better

Use YOUR C program source file in the tests.

// Simple commands
ls -a -l                       : show the ls results of CWD
cat file                       : show file contents

// Choose gedit OR nano OR vi OR emacs as the EDITOR
EDITOR file                    : show you can edit the file

// I/O redirections		   
cat file > out; ls -l; cat out : show out file exist and show its contents
cat file >> out; ls -l         : show out file size doubled
cat < file                     : show file contents

// PIPES
cat file | grep printf         : show lines containing printf

cat < file | grep printf > out : show pipe with I/O redirection

cat file | grep printf | more  : two pipes
      
cat file | cat | cat | grep printf : multiple pipes
